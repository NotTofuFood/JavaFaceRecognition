#Java Face Recognition

Description: I made this for fun in Java. I did not use any librarys. Pure Java. Around 95% accurate.

Side Note: Yes I am Aware Of My Spelling Mistakes With The Word Recognition 


# How It Works

* First, You Put An Image (Named Face.png) Into The Resources Folder. That Image Then Gets Scaled Down To The Size Of A Reference Image.

* From There, The Pixels Of Both Images Are Compared. If The Face.png Image Shares 78.5% (Or More) Pixels With The Reference Image, It Will Detect A Face.

* Since This Has 0 Machine Learning or Artifical Intelligance, It Will Not Be Too Accurate At Times. It Also Requires (preferably) A Closeup Of A Face/Object For More Accurate Results. 

# Known Errors

* Sometimes Resizing The Face.png Image Results In An Error
